**Homework 1: Prompting LLMs for Code Generation**
  The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize you with the process of prompting a Large Language Model
(LLM) for Python code generation. There are two goals that you want to achieve with this homework:
• Data Exploration
• Prompt Engineering

Homework 2: Prompting LLMs for Machine Learning
  The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize you with the process of building machine learning models
by prompting a Large Language Model (LLM). This process is divided into three main parts:
1. Data Exploration
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Model Building and Evaluation
Homework 1wasspecifically about Data Exploration. In this homework, we will focus on Data Preprocessing,
and Model Building and Evaluation. We will use the same two datasets.

Homework 3: Wafer Map Failure Pattern
  Homework 3 is slightly different from the previous assignments. In earlier assignments, your goal
was to craft a single precise prompt. This time, however, your goal is to leverage an LLM to
complete a long piece of code. Your task is to directly call your desired LLM from within the
provided ipynb file to complete the code yourself. The notebook also includes a motivating story
and helpful guidelines, so please follow the flow step by step as you build your solution.
In addition to code generation, if any questions come to mind while working through the process,
you should also include those questions in the ipynb file by making API calls to the LLM.
The grading for this assignment will focus on two main criteria:
1. Whether you successfully completed the code using the LLM effectively.
2. What kinds of questions you asked the LLM during the process.

Homwwork 4: Get a feel for using Cline and explore how to use it efficiently and effectively
  Using Cline effectively makes it more powerful than using LLMs, we will perform some simple tasks using the Diabetes dataset, 
which is a binary classification dataset

Homework 5: Build The Best ML Model
  This final homework will be a comprehensive assignment that integrates everything you have done
in your previous homework assignments.
In Homework 1 and 2, you learned how to build Machine Learning models using simple datasets.
In this process, you explored not only how to write prompts when using LLMs to write code (Prompt
Engineering), but also how to review generated code.
Homework 3 used a dataset where you had to perform Feature Engineering yourself. In this
process, you experienced how to write prompts to LLMs when writing long and complex code, and
how to provide context when writing long code step by step, which differs from writing a single
short piece of code.
Homework 4, we introduced Cline. Unlike before when you had to collaborate with LLMs for
prompt writing, code execution, code debugging, etc., using Cline allows you to complete code
using only natural language. This is because Cline helps with all aspects including plan generation,
code generation, execution, and debugging.
Once you complete this homework, you will have accumulated multiple experiences of Machine
Learning model building as well as experience writing ML code from start to finish using Prompt
Engineering and Cline.
In this homework, you will build a Machine Learning model using the WM-811K dataset that
you used in Homework 3. What makes this homework different from Homework 3 is that this
homework has no template or storyline, and unlike Homework 3 where you just needed to exceed
the test accuracy threshold, in this homework your test accuracy is your final score!
