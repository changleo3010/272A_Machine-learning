Homework 1: Prompting LLMs for Code Generation
The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize you with the process of prompting a Large Language Model
(LLM) for Python code generation. There are two goals that you want to achieve with this homework:
• Data Exploration
• Prompt Engineering

Homework 2: Prompting LLMs for Machine Learning
The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize you with the process of building machine learning models
by prompting a Large Language Model (LLM). This process is divided into three main parts:
1. Data Exploration
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Model Building and Evaluation
Homework 1wasspecifically about Data Exploration. In this homework, we will focus on Data Preprocessing,
and Model Building and Evaluation. We will use the same two datasets.
